# hop-discord-bot

A proof-of-concept application using hop's CLI and an in-process running
instance of the engine to respond to Discord commands.

## How do I use it

Mention the bot and type a command:

```
@HopDB increment foo
```

It'll increment `foo` and respond with the new integer value. It's like running
[hop-cli], but from a bot.

## Can I invite the bot

Not for now.

## Where can I try it

[On our Discord][discord].
